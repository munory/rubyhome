                <h2 class="privacy__heading">2. COMMUNICATIONS POLICY.</h2>

                <p class="privacy__text">When you provide your Contact Information, you are providing your express consent to receive communications from us. Communications from us may include telemarketing messages via email, landline phone, fax, cellular phone, text messages (including SMS and MMS), and notifications through any app that we may produce ("Communications"). We may use an automatic telephone dialing system which may use an artificial or pre-recorded voice or robotexts. Your carrier's standard rates and charges may apply. Agreeing to receive Communications is not a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or services from us.</p>

                <p class="privacy__text">You represent and warrant that: (i) you are at least 18 years old; (ii) you live in the United States (or Canada, in such case, the Canadian consents below will apply); (iii) you are not registered on a national or statewide Do Not Call list; or you otherwise grant the Company a waiver to such registration to send you Communications; (iv) you are the account holder of, or have the required consent to provide the phone numbers and e-mail address provided; (v) the phone numbers and email addresses provided are accurate, and you will provide us notice if you release either such account to another.</p>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(a) Communication Frequency.</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">Communications we send to you will vary, as the individual salesperson working with you will determine the frequency.</p>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(b) Revoking Consent/Opting Out.</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">You may revoke your consent to receive Communications at any time. To stop receiving text messages, reply "STOP" to any of our texts. To stop receiving emails, click the "UNSUBSCRIBE" link when provided, or reply "UNSUBSCRIBE" to the email when the automated unsubscribe link is unavailable. Please allow up to fourteen (14) business days before you stop receiving Newsletters. You may also continue to receive emails unrelated to marketing. To stop receiving phone calls, please communicate that request to us through the phone or email us at team@rubyhome.com to update your communication preferences. We make commercially reasonable efforts to comply with any opt-out request from you, and we may send a final communication to you that confirms such request.</p>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(c) Canadian Residents.</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">In addition to the consent provided above, Canadian residents agree to the following compliance provisions, with respect to Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and the Canadian Provincial Law, including Alberta's Personal Information Protection Act, and Quebec's Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector. You agree to the provisions governing the use and disclosures of Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy and you understand that Communication will continue until you opt-out, which will indicate that you are no longer considering real estate opportunities or the services we provide. Your Personal Information may also be transmitted to, used in, and stored in the United States.</p>

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">3. SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES.</h2>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(a) Service Providers.</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">Like most companies, we use tools from third party service providers to help us with some or all of our business through the Site(s) ("Service Providers"), and depending on the service we need, these Service Providers may have access to your Personal Information. For example, our third-party service vendors (such as mortgage lenders, insurance brokers, and title companies) may collect Personal Information from you, provided to them by you to help determine service eligibility. We also use Service Providers for the following purposes:</p>

                <ol class="privacy__list">
                    <li>To host the Site(s).</li>
                    <li>To deliver emails and newsletters.</li>
                    <li>To help us conduct web analytics on the Site(s).</li>
                    <li>To determine service eligibility.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="privacy__text">We do not have direct control over how Service Providers use your Personal Information, and we cannot guarantee that our Service Providers will use your Personal Information as required in our contract with them. For this reason, we are not responsible for our Service Providers' misuse of your Personal Information.</p>

                <p class="privacy__text">For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" class="privacy__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" class="privacy__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(b) Business Transfers.</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">As we continue to develop our business, we may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, or we merge with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that we reserve the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(c) Legal.</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">We may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities and other legal processes, and to establish/exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">4. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES.</h2>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(a) Tracking Technologies. We and our Service Providers use tracking technologies such as cookies, local storage, web beacons, pixel tags, tokens, widgets, etc. ("Tracking Technology"), to conduct analytics and to optimize the Site(s) functionality and performance. We may use both session cookies (which expire when you close out of your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your browser until deleted).</h3>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(b) What are Cookies and Tracking Technologies?</h3>

                <p class="privacy__text">Tracking Technologies are small data files that are stored on your Device by a website you visit. Commonly, companies use cookies on their websites to identify visitors, to remember visitors' preferences, to better understand how visitors use and interact with the website, and to keep visitors logged into their accounts while they navigate the website. Cookies are either first-party cookies, which belong to the domain you are visiting, or third-party cookies, which are set by and belong to a different domain than the one that you're currently visiting.</p>

                <h3 class="privacy__subheading">(c) Your Control Over Cookies. In some cases, a third party might give you the ability to opt-out of receiving their cookies. Please review the third party's privacy policy and/or cookie policy for more information. You can also control how cookies are used by updating your browser settings to accept or refuse all or certain types of cookies. If you choose to reject certain cookies, please note that the Site(s) and/or some of its features may not function properly.</h3>

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">5. HOW IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION USED FOR ANALYTICS?</h2>

                <p class="privacy__text">As an online business, it is important for us to know how users interact with our Site(s).

                <p class="privacy__text">Throughout the Site(s), you may see links to third-party websites or applications. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party sites, and when accessing their sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">7. DATA RETENTION.</h2>

                <p class="privacy__text">How long we store your Personal Information will depend on the purpose that we originally collected it.

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">8. SECURITY.</h2>

                <p class="privacy__text">The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your information, both during transmission and once it is received. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. While no security system is completely secure, we and our Service Providers take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or disclosure of the information collected by us.</p>

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">9. MINORS.</h2>

                <p class="privacy__text">The Site(s) are not directed to users under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect information from users under the age of 18.

                <h2 class="privacy__heading">10. ACCESSING, MANAGING, AND/OR UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</h2>
